javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/Main.java
java -cp bin Main
```

## Performance Optimization

The project utilizes multiple data structures for optimal performance:
- Priority Queue (MaxHeap): Student ranking management
- HashMap: Fast ID-based lookups
- ArrayList: List storage and display
- Set: Search index management

## Key Components

- DashboardPanel: Main statistics screen
- StudentFormPanel: Student data management form
- PerformanceTestPanel: ADT performance comparison
- Custom UI Components: Modern look and feel elements
